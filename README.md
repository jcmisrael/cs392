# CS 392 #
Contained within is all my work for cs392, Systems Programming, at Stevens Institute of Technology

# Building #
Each Project can be built by running `make` in their directory

# Testing #
Testing requires [CUnit](http://cunit.sourceforge.net/), and can be compiled with `make` in the testing directory.
